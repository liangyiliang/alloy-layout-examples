# Alloy layout examples

| Example        | Description | Source      | Available visualizations | 
|----------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| [ertms-level3](ertms-level3) | Model of the track layout and train positions in the ERTMS Level 3 standard for train control and signaling. | Extracted from this [case study paper.](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10009-019-00540-4), but adapted to have direct relationships between each `VSS` and the respective `TDD` and between `Train` and the respective `VSS`s, instead of just having the first and last `VSS` of each `TDD` and the front and rear `VSS` of each `Train`. | Analyzer, Alcino |
| [farmer-puzzle](farmer-puzzle) | Model of one possible state of the well known farmer puzzle, with near and far objects captured by subsets. | [Alloy sample model distributed with the Analyzer](https://github.com/AlloyTools/models/blob/master/puzzles/farmer-chicken-fox/farmer.als) assuming it was modeled in Alloy 6. | Analyzer, Alcino |
| [file-system](file-system) | File system model allowing an object to appear in different entries of a directory with different names. | The exact same model described in the [structural modeling chapter of the Practical Alloy online book.](https://practicalalloy.github.io/chapters/structural-modeling/index.html) A very similar model is used also on the [Cope-and-Drag paper](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.ECOOP.2025.26) with `object` being called `content` and including a redundant `parent` relationship, which is also included in the model. | Analyzer, Alcino, CnD |
| [production-line](production-line) | Model of a production line for manufactring products made from parts that are either other products or materials. | Adapted from this [Alloy4Fun exercise](http://alloy4fun.inesctec.pt/n5rgKi6xhjymixNGy), removing signatures and fields that are not relevant for layout. | Analyzer, Alcino |
| [ring-network](ring-network) | Model of a ring network where messages are the node ids, as used in an abstract version of Chang and Roberts leader election protocol. | Extracted from the model of the protocol described in the [Protocol design chapter of the Practical Alloy online book.](https://practicalalloy.github.io/chapters/protocol-design/index.html)| Analyzer, Alcino |
| [social-network](social-network) | Very simple model of a photo sharing social network, where users follow other users, post photos, and can see photos posted be followed users. | Adapted from this [Alloy4Fun exercise](http://alloy4fun.inesctec.pt/u6EPDxzJrQSEKRwSf), removing signatures and fields that are not relevant for layout. | Analyzer, Alcino |
